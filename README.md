# Thread Synchronization
<br>
<br>

# Description:
Create a main thread
<br>
<br>

# How it works:
Insert the Process Quantity and the Quantum, respectively. <br>
Then insert the Start time and the Time needed to Finish the processes for each Process. <br>
Aftert that the operations will proceed and collect the average execution time, average wait time and average response time.

Ex:
```
Proccess Quantity: 4       Quantum: 2
```
```4 2
Start Time: 0  Time Needed to Finish: 20
Start Time: 0  Time Needed to Finish: 10
Start Time: 4  Time Needed to Finish: 6
Start Time: 4  Time Needed to Finish: 8
```
